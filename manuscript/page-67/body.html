It appears to me most extraordinary that any persons should choose such a foundation; but I understand it is far from remarkable, and that these accidental eminences are improved to advantage in this flat country, the face of which in a course of years has undergone important changes, from the habit of the people of leaving crumbling ruins to accumulate. Here the line of the principal street can be traced, extending in a straight direction from the shore of the old harbour to the Gate of Resheed, which is at the eastern extremity of the enclosure; and the direction of the other great street, which crossed the former at right angles, is observable.</p><p>Resheed is the name of the town which the English call Rosetta.</p></div> </div>
