<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>211Quarterly Review—vol. 19,     .</p><p>Most ancient authors who have described this monument assert, in opposition to Diodorus, that its founder was buried in it.</p><p>The Great Pyramid is surrounded, on three sides, by almost innumerable tombs. On the east are three small pyramids; and on the same side, and on the west and south, are many oblong tombs, flat-topped, and with sides inclining inwards. Some persons who have been unreasonable enough to doubt whether the pyramids are sepulchral monuments, must, I think, be convinced of their error by the discoveries of Colonel Vyse: long before which, my brother found bones and mummy-rags in the principal pyramid of Sakkárah.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
