After descending rather more than sixty feet, an aperture is seen on the southern side, which is the entrance of a kind of grotto (<em>s</em>) between five and six feet high, and about three times as long, turning to the right. It is hollowed out in a vein of coarse but compact gravel, and the well in consequence of this vein, is lined with masonry for the space of a few feet above and below the grotto. Where the masonry ceases (<em>t</em>) the well takes a sloping direction and continues so to the bottom; but towards the bottom (see <em>u</em> in the section) the slope becomes more steep. All the sloping part is cut through the solid rock below the foundation of the pyramid, and is of a square form. At the bottom of the well (<em>v</em>) is a horizontal passage six feet long, communicating with the first passage, two hundred and twelve feet below the aperture by which one ascends to the second passage.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The first passage of the pyramid from the aperture</p></div> </div>
